# Advanced-Calculator

This program is intended to be a common function/graphing calculator with the following features:
- Standard operations (+, -, x, /)
- Pythagorean Theorem
- Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan)
- Quadratic Formula
- Molarity
- Conversion from Celsius to Fahrenheit
- Conversion from Fahrenheit to Celcius
- Conversion from pounds to kilograms
- Conversion from kilograms to pounds

## What does the program do?

Displays text prompting user input, check for input validity. If inputs are valid, solution will be displayed. If inputs are not valid for function, an error message will be displayed and the user will be taken back to the index page. From index page, user will be prompted to re-enter the input correctly.
